Create a web application for browsing Rick & Morty characters.
The API documentation is located on this URL: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.

You should consume the REST API, not the GraphQL version of the API.

The web application should have a single grid view, displaying characters as cards (first 20 characters).

Character cards should display characterâ€™s image and name as well as a like button.

By clicking on a character card, the user should be presented with character details, showing all other fields of the character schema.

If communication errors occur, they should be presented to the user without breaking the usability of the application.

How you design and display any of the pages/components is totally up to you.

Use ES6 modules
